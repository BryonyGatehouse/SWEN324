# Software Correctness

This course is concerned with the development of correct software, especially the use of formal requirements and specifications to develop high-integrity software. This has applications in several areas, such as safety-critical systems (e.g. commercial airliners, space systems, etc) and high-performance concurrent systems. The course will examine a range of principles and techniques which underpin a rigorous approach to the specification and implementation of software. A sequence of assignments and labs will see a range of tools being used to specify small software systems, and to check that they meet their requirements.

### Course learning objectives
Students who pass this course will be able to:
1. Explain what it means for a system to be correct, what engineering techniques we can use to increase confidence in correctness, and why this is important.
2. Use formal structures such as sets, functions, relations and sequences to model software systems.
3. Use formal notations to specify desired properties of software systems, such as assertions, pre and postconditions, variants, and invariants.
4. Use formal tools to check that systems correctly implement their desired properties.
5. Use formal reasoning to explain why a particular system is correct with respect to a specification.
